Code Usage Guide
This guide explains how to use the provided code to train and evaluate different models for image classification. The code includes implementations of three models: CNN, DenseNet, and ResNet, and provides functionality for model pruning and conversion to TensorFlow Lite format. The models are trained on image datasets of three different resolutions: 8x8, 16x16, and 32x32.

Prerequisites
Before using the code, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.x installed
TensorFlow and TensorFlow Model Optimization libraries installed
The image datasets for training and testing prepared in separate directories
Dependencies
The code requires the following Python libraries:
